File in which necessary paths for model checking are defined.

path_to_prism is the absolute or relative path to the prism executable. Note that it has to include the executable file,
not just the folder. Eg. /usr/edi/prism/prism.bat and NOT /usr/edi/prism/

If you learn one of the provided examples path to properties should be relative or
absolute path to 'Benchmarking\prism_eval_props'.
